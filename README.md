## Introduction
This project will be progressed parallel to my learming on deep learning on coursera https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning#about. Meanwhile, the scope of this project is not limited to existing concepts of machine learning, I also wish to discover possibilities of neural network such as logical reasoning, conversation and intuitive thinking.

## Code
